            <p>Name: Timmy Chang<br>Location: Auckland, New Zealand<br>Nationality: Taiwanese<br>Age: 14<br>Hobby: speedcubing<br><br>Hi there! I’m Timmy, a passionate speedcuber from New Zealand. I’ve been fascinated by the Rubik’s Cube since 2022, and what started as a casual hobby quickly turned into a thrilling pursuit of speed and precision.

                I specialize in 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, pyraminx, megaminx and skewb, and my personal best for the 3x3 cube is 11.49 seconds. I love the challenge of solving complex puzzles and the satisfaction that comes with breaking my own records.
                
                When I’m not twisting and turning cubes, you can find me flying rc planes, playing flight sim and playing games. I also enjoy sharing my passion with others, whether it’s through tutorials, competitions, or just casual meetups with fellow cubers.
                
                Feel free to connect with me if you share the same passion for speedcubing or just want to chat about the latest techniques and strategies. Let’s keep those cubes turning!</p>
